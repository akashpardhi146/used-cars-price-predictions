# used-cars-price-predictions
The used car price prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the prices of used cars based on various factors. The model will be trained using a dataset containing information about used cars, such as the make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant features.
